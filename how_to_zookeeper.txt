To install and run zookeeper:
>wget http://apache.mirrors.ionfish.org/zookeeper/current/zookeeper-3.4.10.tar.gz
>tar xzf zookeeper-3.4.10.tar.gz

Create a new config file under zookeeper-3.4.10/conf (I named mine zoo.cfg)
Here, you can edit the defaults - the one you need to change is dataDir, it can't be in tmp
(I set mine to empty folder /var/zookeeper)

To start zookeeper:
> sudo bin/zkServer.sh start

To connect (via Java CLI):
>bin/zkCli.sh -server 120.0.0.1:2181

Note: Your port might be different, and if you're connecting to a different server the ip won't be localhost

To add to the cluster in replicated mode:
server.1 = zoo1:2888:3888


It's common for zookeeper nodes to die, so you'll want to supervise them. Here we'll use daemontools.

For installation of actual storm:
>wget http://mirror.jax.hugeserver.com/apache/storm/apache-storm-1.2.1/apache-storm-1.2.1.tar.gz
>tar -xzf v1.2.1.tar.gz
To install java:
>sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64

Console: https://[nimbus IP]:3000

To be able to access the internal ip, use the a security group enabling all ICMP
(or ICMP from just that security group if you want to be safe)

To run nimbus:
sudo nohup /home/storm/apache-storm-0.9.5/bin/storm nimbus > /dev/null 2>&1 &
